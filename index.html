            <img class="pic" src="https://i.redd.it/y8jdpwtc5qj31.png"><p> Hello my name is Rodny. I'm just going to start typing what comes to mind because i literally have no idea what to say. So at the moment I'm fighting back the urge to smash my computer on the floor because I can't figure out how to move the a tags to the other side of the page. The only thing making my soul happy right now is that I can hear my brother cursing up a storm cause he's probably getting his ass kicked in madden online.</p>
